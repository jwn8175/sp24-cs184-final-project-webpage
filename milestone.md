## Progress Summary

To incorporate our filter ideas into the graphics pipeline, we decided to first bind the input image as a texture input to the shader program, and then do all of our filtering color computations in the fragment shader. We decided to set up our program in python, using the `moderngl` and `moderngl-window` packages to execute our shader program and render outputs.

Setting up the project boilerplate and learning how to use the packages took a fair amount of time, but we were able to fully implement both the square and circle variants of the Kuwahara.
