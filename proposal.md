## Creating Painterly Renderings Using Different Filter Techniques
{: .no_toc }

By: Jonathan, Ayra Jafri, Jay Ni, and Vanessa Qiu

## Summary

Given an input image, we will create an artistic, non-realistic rendering by applying the Kuwahara and Voronoi filters. We will compare the output quality between different implementations of these aforementioned filters and try to qualitatively determine which produce the best results.

## Problem Description

## Goals and Deliverables

For our project, we plan to create a program that can take an input image, apply the Kuwahara filter and/or Voronoi filter to the image depending on what is specified, and output the result. We plan to have three different implementations of the Kuwahara filter: the square, circle, and anisotropic implementations, and the user will be able to specify which implementation of the Kuwahara filter they want applied. Shown below are some images that demonstrate what each filter and specific implementation should look like. The first image shows the original image of a bird. The next three images show square Kuwahara filtering, circle Kuwahara filtering, and anisotropic filtering applied on the original image, respectively. With our program, we hope to achieve these images. TODO: Jay needs to add images.

## Schedule

### Week 1

Implement the Kuwahara filter, including the square, circle, and anisotrophic variants.

### Week 2

Implement the Voronoi filter.

### Week 3

Buffer week to finish up leftover work from previous two weeks. If time allows, implement cel-shading.

### Week 4

Work on the final project deliverables, including webpage, presentation, and image samples. Assuming we are still working on a non-interactive program at this point, create a command line program that allows the user to input images to generate output images.
