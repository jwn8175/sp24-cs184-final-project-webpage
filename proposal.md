# Project Proposal

## Creating Painterly Renderings Using the Kuwahara and Voronoi Filter Techniques

By: Jonathan, Ayra, Jay, and Vanessa

## Summary

Given an input image, we will create an artistic, non-realistic rendering by applying the Kuwahara and Voronoi filters. We will compare the output quality between different implementations of these aforementioned filters and try to qualitatively determine which produce the best results.

## Problem Description

## Goals and Deliverables

## Schedule

### Week 1

Implement the Kuwahara filter, including the square, circle, and anisotrophic variants.

### Week 2

Implement the Voronoi filter.

### Week 3

Buffer week to finish up leftover work from previous two weeks. If time allows, implement cel-shading.

### Week 4

Work on the final project deliverables, including webpage, presentation, and image samples. Assuming we are still working on a non-interactive program at this point, create a command line program that allows the user to input images to generate output images.
